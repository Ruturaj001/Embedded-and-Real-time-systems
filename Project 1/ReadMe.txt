An embedded, stand-alone 68HCS12 program that will display a histogram 
of one-thousand, rising edge pulse inter-arrival times. The inter-arrival
time between pulses is expected to average around 1.0 millisecond, but the
histogram should represent the range of 100 “buckets” between the values 
of 950 and 1050 microseconds.
